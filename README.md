# AetherQuest

### Welcome
This was a project I wrote for a the Business Professionals of America Software Engineering Team competition. It placed in the the top ten games in 2014. 

The project asked us to make a retro-side scroller game, and we opted to make a random dungeon generation game, with lighting, random loot, and monsters. 

We had several months to implement and design it in our free time, while juggling responsibilities like High School and extracurricular activities like Marching Band.
